HISTORY
-------

Version 0.0.5
---------------------
* urchin now unsets `CDPATH`.
* The documentation for `urchin -x` was removed because it was confusing.

Version 0.0.4
---------------------
* Switch urchin -x to urchin -sh and fix some problems with it
* Documentation

Version 0.0.3
---------------------
General tidying

Run with different shells in three ways

* urchin -s
* $TEST_SHELL variable with $TEST_SHELL
* $TEST_SHELL variable with urchin -sh

Set NULL_GLOB so zsh doesn't print a warning.

Before version 0.0.3
----------------------
We adjusted the input parameters so it is harder to accidentally run all executable files in you
r home directory.

We added directory-based indents.
